Netflix Clone

Welcome to the Netflix Clone project! This is a simplified version of a streaming service inspired by Netflix. While the project is a work in progress, it already includes several exciting features. Please read through this README to learn more about the capabilities and future plans for this project.

Features
Route Navigation: The project allows users to switch between three main routes:

Home: Displays a selection of movies based on genre, with a slider to reveal more movies in each category.
My List: Users can view a list of movies they've added for later viewing.
Popular (Work in Progress): Will eventually show a list of movies with ratings greater than a specified amount.
Movie Cards: Movies on the home page are presented as cards, and hovering over a card reveals a pop-up display. The pop-up includes options to play the movie, like it, and add it to the user's list.

Persistent Data: Users can interact with movies by liking them and adding them to their list. These interactions will be saved in the database.

Banner Image: The banner image at the top of the page changes randomly on each refresh, providing a fresh look for users.

Easter Egg - Netflix Jingle: Discover a fun Easter egg by clicking on the Netflix jingle icon at the top right corner to hear the iconic sound.
